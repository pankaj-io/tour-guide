        <p>Being home to several ancient Temples, 
            Karnataka is the ultimate destination 
            for Temple tours. It is simply amazing 
            how one State can be home to many Temples
             belonging to different dynasties. Known for 
             their religious beliefs, historical significance, 
             and architectural grandeur, Karnataka Temples 
             are a must-visit for every spiritual soul 
             and history buff. Here is a list of just some 
             of the most famous Temples that can quench 
             your thirst for spiritually stimulating trips.</p>
             <br>
             <h3>Region </h3>
        <p>Karnataka is divided into four distinct regionsâ€”the 
            coastal plain, the hill ranges (the Western Ghats), 
            the Karnataka Plateau to the east, and the black-soil 
            tract to the northwest. The coastal plain represents a 
            northward continuation of the Malabar Coast, with sand dunes 
            giving place inland to small alluvial plains and lagoons
            . The coast itself is difficult to access, except by sea.</p>

                <p><i><u>Features :-</u> </i>Dedicated to Lord Krishna, it is one of the most revered Temples
                     in the region. The presiding deity is depicted as Bal Krishna. However, unlike other 
                    Temples, the idol cannot be seen directly. Devotees can see the idol through a 9-holed 
                    window called Navagraha Kitiki. The sacred Sri Krishna Temple and Matta (monastery) date 
                    back to the 13th century and attract devotees from far and wide.</p>
